Thanks Onaka (@onk) for contributing to this.

## Version 2.0.23
- For ActiveRecord 6.0 and above, if the the configuration (database.yml) has multiple databases defined, it will discard the DATABASE_URL spec (if it is supplied from environment variables), following [Active Record convention here](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/activerecord/lib/active_record/database_configurations.rb#L169). Thanks JoakimKlaxit (@JoakimKlaxit) for contributing to this.


## Version 2.0.22

- Added compability fix for ActiveRecord 6.1 ([#107](https://github.com/janko-m/sinatra-activerecord/issue/107)), as they have moved ConnectionUrlResolver to another module. Thanks Richard Peck(@richpeck) for contributing to this.

## Version 2.0.21

- If both config/database.yml and $DATABASE_URL is present, the database configuration will be merged from this two, and $DATABASE_URL's variables will take precedence. (https://github.com/sinatra-activerecord/sinatra-activerecord/pull/103)

## Version 2.0.9

- Don't try to load config/database.yml if `$DATABASE_URL` is present ([#55](https://github.com/janko-m/sinatra-activerecord/pull/55), thanks to @exviva)

## Version 2.0.8

- Use the ConnectionManagement AR middelware for clearing active connections

## Version 2.0.7

- Allow multiple databases to be used ([#54](https://github.com/janko-m/sinatra-activerecord/pull/54))

## Version 2.0.6

* Prefer `DATABASE_URL` to config/database.yml ([#47](https://github.com/janko-m/sinatra-activerecord/issue/47)).

## Version 2.0.5

* Disabled ActiveRecord logging in tests

## Version 2.0.4

* You're now encouraged to load the app in the `:load_config` Rake task. This
  way your app will only be required when executing ActiveRecord tasks, and
  not other potential tasks which don't need the database. Your Rakefile can
  now be updated to this:

  ```rb
  require "sinatra/activerecord/rake"

  namespace :db do
    task :load_config do
      require "./app" # or whatever your app name is
    end
  end
  ```

* ActiveRecord isn't logged in production anymore.

## Version 2.0.3

- Use `File.exist?` instead of `File.exists?` to avoid warnings (thanks to [**@matthiase**](https://github.com/matthiase)).

## Version 2.0.2

- Allow setting the environment as a String, aside from Symbol.

## Version 2.0.1

- Fixed the issue where it mattered in which order `sinatra/activerecord/rake`
  and `./app` are required.

## Version 2.0.0

- ActiveRecord 4.1 is now supported.
- Rake tasks are now directly imported from ActiveRecord, which means *all* of
  the tasks are now available.

## Version 1.7.0

- Added `db:reset` and `db:migrate:reset` tasks ([#27](https://github.com/janko-m/sinatra-activerecord/pull/27)).
  Thanks to @csgavino.

## Version 1.6.0

- Added ability to specify folder for the database ([#26](https://github.com/janko-m/sinatra-activerecord/pull/26)).
  Thanks to @jamesrwhite.

## Version 1.5.0

- Added ability to specify `:sql` format of the schema, as well as
  `db:structure` tasks ([#25](https://github.com/janko-m/sinatra-activerecord/pull/25)).
  Thanks to @icambron.

## Version 1.4.0

- Added `db:test:prepare` Rake task.

## Version 1.3.0

- Added `db:create`, `db:drop` and `db:reset` Rake tasks.

## Version 1.2.5

- Fix a bug with ActiveRecord 3.0.

## Version 1.2.4

- By default look for a `config/database.yml` in the root of the running process.

## Version 1.2.3

- Allow ActiveRecord 4

## Version 1.2.2

- Fix not allowing environments other than "development", "test" and "production".

## Version 1.2.1

- Fix specifying database from a file not working properly.

## Version 1.2.0

- You can now set a custom migrations directory. Take a look at
[this wiki](https://github.com/janko-m/sinatra-activerecord/wiki/Changing-the-migrations-directory).

- You can now set the database to a YAML file. Take a look at
[this wiki](https://github.com/janko-m/sinatra-activerecord/wiki/Alternative-database-setup).

## Version 1.1.2

- Users are now warned if they use SQLite URLs with 2 slashes.

## Version 1.1.1

- The `set :database` command now accepts everything that
  `ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection` accepts. A Hash
  is one example:

```ruby
set :database, {
  adapter: "sqlite3",
  database: "db/foo.db",
  pool: 5,
  timeout: 5000
}
```

- The database is now reset whenever you specify it with `set :database`.
- The migrations are now logged just like in Rails.

## Version 1.1.0

- If no database is specified, it will try to read from the `DATABASE_URL`
  environment variable (which is often set in production). This was
  removed in 1.0.0, but now I'm bringing it back.

## Version 1.0.1

- Removed deprecation warnings when using the `#database` helper.

## Version 1.0.0

- Fixed the database not working. Sorry, I won't let it happen again.

### Changes that are NOT backwards compatible

- There is no more "default" database. Now you always have to specify
  the database you want to connect to, it doesn't default to
  `"sqlite://#{environment}.db"` anymore.

- When you're setting an SQLite database, you now have to put 3 slashes
  after `sqlite:` instead of 2. So instead of `sqlite://database.db` you
  have to write `sqlite:///database.db`. This is now a valid URL.

## Version 0.2.1 (yanked)

- The previous version was yanked, because I forgot to add the
  `db:rollback` task (I didn't figure out how to test it yet, otherwise
  I would know it was missing). This version is then actually 0.2.0.

## Version 0.2.0 (yanked)

- Added `db:rollback` rake task.

- If you're using SQLite, you can now specify the path to where
  you want your database file to be (thanks to **@mpalmer** for this). Refer to
  [this wiki](https://github.com/janko-m/sinatra-activerecord/wiki/SQLite).

- Verify connection before requests (a MySQL error which caused the
  app to disconnect from the database after some longer time).

- Clear active connections after each request.

- `activerecord` gem is now a dependency, so you don't have to specify
  it anymore. The required version is >= 3.
